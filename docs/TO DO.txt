var tensor = TFTensor.CreateString(image); 
Where image is byte[] image

Ok, Bitmap has a constructor that takes a Stream, so you can do the following:
1. Change the ImageInputData class to have a field called "Image" of type Bitmap.
2. Change the pipeline to start with ImageEstimatorsCatalog.Resize instead of ImageEstimatorsCatalog.LoadImages
3. When you get a MemoryStream like above, you write var input = new ImageInputData() { Image = new Bitmap(image) }; Then you pass it to the pipeline the same way you would pass the object containing the image path to the pipline you had before.

CONVERTING to BitMap:
UPDATE: keep in mind that according to the documentation, and the source code I've been reading through, an ArgumentException will be thrown on these conditions:

stream does not contain image data or is null.
-or-
stream contains a PNG image file with a single dimension greater than 65,535 pixels.
